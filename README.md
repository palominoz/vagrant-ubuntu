vagrant-ubuntu
==============

## Why?
Minimalism at its core. Just spawn a freshly made linux box with ubuntu from vagrant. I find it really useful specially when you need to test packages or non-standard configurations you want to try before doing it where you can break things.

## Contribute?
Its just a linux box ;)
